## About me
I'm a 26 year old curious mind person who likes and wants to learn smth new. Now I'm excited about JS/FE pre-school course (RS School). It's a challenge for me - my first steps in the IT field. At the same time I'm a barista, so I have strong communication, observational and multitasking skills, I'm good at teamwork and I also have a little management experience.
